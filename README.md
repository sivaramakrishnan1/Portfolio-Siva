# My Portfolio Site

## What I learnt apart from basic:
1. **HTML**
	1. Dedicated `<footer>` tag in HTML
	2. Block container `<div>` and `<id>` tag
	3. The inline container `<span>` tag

2. **CSS**
	1. Display
		1. `flex`
		2. `Grid` (most favourite ðŸ¤ŒðŸ¤Œ)
		
	2. Position
		1. `sticky`
		2. `absolute`
		3. `fixed`
		
	3. Hover animations 

3. **Multiple device support**
	1. Supports on computer
	2. Supports on mobile
	3. *But not supports on tablet* (Kind of tired)

So happy that I done **UI/UX course** in the past. It helped me to decide the design of this site at many points.
